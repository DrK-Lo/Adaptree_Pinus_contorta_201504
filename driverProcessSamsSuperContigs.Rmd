### Enrichment analysis based on Sam's "super-contig" status. 

See Sam's markdown file for how super contigs were analyzed.  He has 4 levels: "bayenv", "both", "neither", "tassel".  Here, I just used a logical (T/F) for the enrichment analysis.  So if a SNP had any of these categories it was considered a super-contig.

Data used here is stored on hulk at /data/seqcap/pine/bwa_pseudo/round2_bams/bayenvResults20150416.  It was transferred to klott@10.122.4.190:/Users/lotterke/Desktop/bayenvResults20150416 to make the markdown files

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::render("driverProcessBayenvResults4VennResultsv3lfmm.Rmd")
```
